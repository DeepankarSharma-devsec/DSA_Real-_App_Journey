# Personal Notes: Python Fundamentals for Big Data

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Module Overview

This is the very first prerequisite module for the entire Big Data
journey.\
The idea is to build a solid Python foundation before diving into
heavier tools like Spark, Kafka, and Airflow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Why Python Matters So Much Here

The whole Big Data stack in this course rests on Python.\
A few reminders I noted down:

### ✔️ PySpark = Python + Apache Spark

So whatever I do in Spark later will rely directly on how comfortable I
am with Python.

### ✔️ Unified Tech Stack

Throughout the course, Python is used to interact with:

-   **Spark**
-   **Kafka**
-   **Airflow**

Having one scripting language for everything keeps things clean and
consistent.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Course Structure + My Learning Strategy

The instructor uses a **bite-sized teaching style**, starting simple and
layering concepts gradually.

Even though I know Python basics already (variables, lists, tuples), the
instructor strongly advises not skipping anything because:

-   The basics are tied to Big Data use cases.
-   Many "simple" topics are revisited from a deeper, more applied
    perspective.

So I'll follow everything in sequence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Topics Covered in This Module

### 🔹 Fundamental Python (quick refresh)

-   Variables\
-   Lists\
-   Tuples

### 🔹 Important Advanced Python (focus items)

-   **OOP Concepts**
-   **File Handling**
-   **Logging** → super important for debugging real Big Data pipelines
-   **Map & Lambda Functions** → aligns with Spark's functional
    programming model

### 🔹 Core Libraries

-   **NumPy**
-   **Pandas**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Why NumPy and Pandas Matter for Big Data

The instructor stresses spending **extra time** on these libraries.

Reason:\
Understanding how operations work in Pandas/NumPy → makes it easier to
grasp **PySpark DataFrames** later.

These libraries form the mental model that Spark scales up.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Student Action Plan (My Own Checklist)

-   [ ] Don't skip the basic videos\
-   [ ] Pay special attention to:
    -   Map/Lambda
    -   Logging\
    -   File Handling\
-   [ ] Strengthen Pandas + NumPy logic\
-   [ ] Always relate Python operations to how they may translate into
    PySpark later

------------------------------------------------------------------------

These notes will guide me through Python basics with a Big Data mindset
before I officially step into PySpark and large-scale processing.
